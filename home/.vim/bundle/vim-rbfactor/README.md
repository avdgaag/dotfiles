# Rbfactor â€“ Refactoring Ruby with Vim

## Introduction

Rbfactor is a set of functions to make refactoring Ruby code in Vim a little
easier. It provides transformation functions and some keymaps to use them.

## Available refactorings

* Extract method
* Extract variable
* Extract constant
* Extract RSpec let
* Add method argument
* Tranform inline modifier into block modifier

For more information, see `:help rbfactor`.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/avdgaag/vim-rbfactor.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help rbfactor`.
