# Description

These are my dotfiles, which set up aliases, functions and environment variables the way I like them for bash, zsh, vim, etc.

# Installation

1. Checkout somewhere on disk, say ~/bin/dotfiles.
2. ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/vim/vim ~/.vim
   ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
   ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/gemrc ~/.gemrc
   ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc
3. Done!

Most of the stuff in these files are snippets found around the interwebs. Some are my own. These are made public 'as is'.
