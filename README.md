# Description

These are my dotfiles, which set up aliases, functions and environment variables the way I like them for bash, zsh, vim, etc.

# Installation

1. Checkout somewhere on disk, say ~/bin/dotfiles.
2. Create some symbolic links:

        ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/vim/vim    ~/.vim
        ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/vim/vimrc  ~/.vimrc
        ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/gemrc      ~/.gemrc
        ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/zshrc      ~/.zshrc
        ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/hgrc       ~/.hgrc
        ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/irbrc      ~/.irbrc
        ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/gitconfig  ~/.gitconfig
        ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/gitignore  ~/.gitignore

3. Done!
